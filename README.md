# Media-Literacy-2.4.5

Media Literacy assignment iteration I made. It didn't have to be HTML but I have taken CS 
courses before and wanted to practice them through this class.

The assignment prompted us to make an advertisement, so I made some additions to one of my favorite fictional character's news ad with HTML code. 

It isn't anything specialbut it's a good start to my coding journey.
